# txtEncryption

txtEncryption takes a message as user input, encrypts it and returns an unreadable collection of letters.
This way the message is protected from unauthorized access and it's integrity is maintained.
Our project aims towards making communication secure and reliable.

Two methods of encryption have been used and both of them are of symmetric nature.
The first one is Caesar Cipher, which is one the oldest and easier to use encryption methods.
The second method used is a modified version of Caesar Cipher where the encryption is slightly stronger.
It is named Z4195 after our team.

To learn more about how the code works, the process is explained in the How It Works? file.

You may use this code in whatever manner you see fit.
