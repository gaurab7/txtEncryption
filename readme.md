@mainpage Text Encryption

## Introduction
Encryption is the process of using an algorithm to transform plain text into encrypted text in order to ensure that sensitive data remains unreadable to unauthorized users. Encrypted data usually looks like a long sequence of random letters and numbers. Once data is encrypted, it can only be turned back into plain text and made readable again by using the correct encryption key.

Encryption is mainly divided into two types:
### Symmetric encryption:
   Symmetric encryption is a form of computerized cryptography using a singular encryption key to guise an electronic message. Its data conversion uses a mathematical algorithm along with a secret key, which results in the inability to make sense out of a message. Symmetric encrpytion is a two-way algorithm because the mathematical algorithm is reversed when decrypting the message along with using the same secret key. Symmetric encryption is also known as private-key encryption and secure-key encryption.

### How Symmetric encryption works?
   Symmetric encryption ciphers use the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message and are often simply passwords. This type of encryption is fast, efficient and well-suited for encrypting documents. It is not often used for highly sensitive communications, however, because both parties are required to have access to the same secret key.
### Asymmetric encryption:
   Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption that uses two separates yet mathematically related keys to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key encrypts data while its corresponding private key decrypts it. This is why it is also known as public key encryption, public key cryptography, and asymmetric key encryption.   The public key is open to everyone. Anyone can access it and encrypt data with it. However, once encrypted, that data can only be unlocked by using the corresponding private key. As you can imagine, the private key must be kept secret to keep it from becoming compromised. So, only the authorized person, server, machine, or instrument has access to the private key.

### How Asymmetric encryption works?
    Asymmetric encryption (also called public key cryptography) works by generating pairs of mathematically related keys. One key is used to encrypt a message and the other key is used to decrypt the message. The sender encrypts a message using the receiver’s publicly available key. The message is then decrypted with the receiver’s private key.Asymmetric encryption is often compared to a locked mailbox that has a slot to receive messages. Anyone who knows the address of the mailbox (the public key) can send a message, but only the owner of the mailbox has the private key to open the mailbox and read the message.
